ðŸ“Š COVID-19 Vaccination EDA & Regression  

This project examines global COVID-19 vaccination data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modelling. The goal is to uncover patterns in vaccination rollout, compare country performance, and build simple predictive insights.  

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries  
Python (Colab), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  

 ðŸ”¹ Dataset  
[Kaggle: COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress)  

 ðŸ”¹ Key Insights  
- Vaccination progress varied widely across countries.  
- Trends show clear leaders and laggards in distribution.  
- Regression model helps understand and predict rollout patterns.
